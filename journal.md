<!-- ====================================INTRO IDEAS================================================= -->

I have been learning web development off and on for for a few years now and i have found that concepts have stuck with me more since I took a *PROJECT BASED LEARNING*
approach. So i had to decide what project can I create a habit tracker application that will Gamify my life. I chose this as my first project because it solves the problem in  my life where I find it difficult to do certain things if i cant track the progress in order to tell if I have actually made any progression.

I have been working on the habit tracker for about a month now. Things are going better then any other project that I have work on.
The fundamental concepts for web dev are in my brain now kinda. The habit tracker has three main sections one section that displays the user bio the players skills and the level of the skill. I know I am just rambling right now. as I type this iI am in Jacksonville Florida sitting by the water. There appears to be a football game at the stadium up the street. It is pretty chill put here at the moment, but let me not get side tracked. So section 1 shows levels a photo of the and that type of stuff.
section 2 has a graph that shows your level in a graphy that i think is visually appealing, and a line graph that show the total number of actions completed in a day for 30 days. The third section is where all the actions (habits) will be created and managed. I need to try harder to keep it as simple as possible for now.
